# k-nearest_neighbour_loan-delinquent
Loan Delinquency Prediction Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

📖 Project Description

This project focuses on predicting loan delinquency using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm.
The model classifies loan applicants as delinquent or non-delinquent based on similarity with historical borrower data.

KNN is a distance-based algorithm that identifies patterns by comparing new data points with the closest existing observations in the dataset.
